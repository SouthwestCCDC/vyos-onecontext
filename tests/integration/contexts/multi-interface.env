# Multi-IP router test context
# Tests multiple IP addresses on a single interface (aliases)
#
# Note: In the individual QEMU test runner the VM has eth0, eth1, and eth2
# available, but the grouped runner only exposes eth0. This test uses aliases
# on eth0 to validate multi-IP (secondary address) functionality on a single
# interface rather than testing multiple NICs.

# Multi-IP router test context
# Tests multiple IP addresses on a single interface (aliases)
#
# Note: The QEMU test VM has eth0, eth1, and eth2 available, but this test
# uses aliases on eth0 to validate multi-IP (secondary address) functionality
# specifically, rather than testing multiple physical interfaces.

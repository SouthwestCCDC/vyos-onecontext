# Error scenario test: Invalid JSON in one section
# Tests graceful error handling when JSON parsing fails
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Valid sections (hostname, SSH, eth0, DHCP) are applied
# - ROUTES_JSON section is skipped due to malformed JSON
# - Error is logged for invalid JSON
# - Exit code indicates errors occurred (but valid config was applied)

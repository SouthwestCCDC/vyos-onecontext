# Quote bug regression test context (issue #40)
#
# This fixture tests the quote handling bug reported in issue #40. The original
# bug occurred when SSH keys contained double quotes in the comment field.
# The parser incorrectly split the key value at the embedded quotes, causing
# configuration generation to fail.
#
# While SSH keys are no longer used in integration tests (we use default VyOS
# credentials instead), this test validates that the parser correctly handles
# quoted values in general.

# OSPF test context
# Tests Phase 3 OSPF dynamic routing functionality
#
# This validates:
# - OSPF router ID configuration
# - Interface-based area assignment (Sagitta syntax)
# - Passive interface configuration
# - Redistribution of connected/static routes
# - Default route origination
#
# Note: In QEMU single-VM tests, OSPF won't form adjacencies (no neighbors),
# but the generated commands and configuration structure should be correct.

# OSPF configuration
# - Router ID set explicitly
# - eth0 in area 0, passive (advertise network, no adjacencies)
# - Redistribute connected routes
# - Originate default route with metric 100

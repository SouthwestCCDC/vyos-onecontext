# DHCP server test context
# Tests Phase 4 DHCP server functionality
#
# This validates:
# - DHCP shared-network creation
# - Subnet configuration with range allocation
# - DHCP options (gateway, DNS, domain name)
# - Lease time configuration
# - Static MAC-to-IP reservations
#
# Note: In QEMU single-VM tests, the DHCP server won't have clients,
# but the generated commands and configuration structure should be correct.

# DHCP configuration
# - eth1 is the DHCP server interface (in QEMU, only eth0 exists, but config should generate)
# - Pool for 10.50.1.100-200
# - Gateway at 10.50.1.1
# - DNS servers: 10.50.1.1 (router itself) and 8.8.8.8
# - 1 hour lease time
# - Domain name: test.local
# - Static reservation for 00:11:22:33:44:55 -> 10.50.1.50

# DHCP server test context
# Tests Phase 4 DHCP server functionality
#
# This validates:
# - DHCP shared-network creation
# - Subnet configuration with range allocation
# - DHCP options (gateway, DNS, domain name)
# - Lease time configuration
# - Static MAC-to-IP reservations
#
# Note: QEMU test VM only has eth0, so we use an alias IP for the DHCP subnet.
# In production, DHCP would be served on a dedicated interface.

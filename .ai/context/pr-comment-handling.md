# PR Comment Handling

## Prerequisites

These instructions use the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/). Install and authenticate:

```bash
# Install (macOS)
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

**Without `gh` CLI**: Use the GitHub web UI instead. Navigate to the PR's "Files changed" tab to view and reply to comments, or the "Conversation" tab to create issues.

## Proactive Check After Push

After pushing changes to a PR, check for review comments.

Use GraphQL to filter out resolved and outdated comments:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "SouthwestCCDC", name: "vyos-onecontext") {
    pullRequest(number: {N}) {
      reviewThreads(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          isResolved
          isOutdated
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              id
              body
              path
              line
              author { login }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false and .isOutdated == false) | .comments.nodes[] | {id: .id, path: .path, line: .line, body: .body}'
```

Replace `{N}` with the PR number.

## Response Workflow

When review comments exist:

1. **Read and understand** each comment
2. **Address the issue** in your worktree
3. **Commit and push** the fix
4. **Reply to the comment** (see below)
5. **Re-check** for new comments

Work is not complete until all comments are addressed and replied to.

## Replying to Comments

Every addressed comment needs an inline reply with AI disclosure:

```bash
gh api repos/SouthwestCCDC/vyos-onecontext/pulls/{N}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Fixed in {SHA}. {brief explanation}

(AI-generated via {AI Tool} w/ {Model})"
```

## Comment Categories

When triaging comments:

| Category | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **A: Fix Now** | Valid issue for this PR | Implement fix, reply with commit SHA |
| **B: Tech Debt** | Valid but scope creep | Create follow-up issue, reply with issue link |
| **C: Larger Issue** | Reveals systemic problem | Discuss before proceeding |
| **D: Disagree** | Misunderstanding or opinion | Reply respectfully explaining position |

## Creating Follow-up Issues

For scope creep items, create an issue and link it:

```bash
gh issue create --repo SouthwestCCDC/vyos-onecontext \
  --title "{description}" \
  --body "Follow-up from PR #{N} review.

{details}

Original comment: https://github.com/SouthwestCCDC/vyos-onecontext/pull/{N}#discussion_r{comment_id}

(AI-generated via {AI Tool} w/ {Model})"
```

Then reply to the original comment with the issue link.

## Feedback Loop Integration

When working within an orchestrator-managed feedback loop:

### Before Starting

1. Check for existing scratch notes:
   ```bash
   ls -la .ai/scratch/issue-{N}/
   ```

2. Read the most recent orchestrator notes to understand:
   - Current round number
   - Previous comments and resolutions
   - Any patterns to watch for

### During Round

Track as you work:
- Comments received this round
- Comments addressed (with commit SHAs)
- Any issues that seem recurring

### After Round

Update scratch notes in `.ai/scratch/issue-{N}/developer/{timestamp}.md`:
- What was addressed
- Any non-convergence patterns noticed
- Recommendations for orchestrator

### Flagging Patterns

Alert the orchestrator if you notice:
- **Recurring issues**: Same feedback appearing 3+ times
- **Circular feedback**: "Change A to B" followed by "Change B to A"
- **Non-convergence**: More issues appearing than being resolved

Include these observations in your summary to help the orchestrator decide whether to continue or escalate.
